This is a simple demo showing how to add a Google Map to your website. For more detailed explanations, see the Google Map guide: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/adding-a-google-map

To run this code you first need to request and activate an API key from Google Maps. See [Step 3](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/adding-a-google-map#step_3_get_an_api_key) in the link above. Then in line 13 in `index.html`, replace `<YOUR API KEY>` with the actual key string.
